Checking group memberships can be resource-intensive. Since group memberships don't change frequently, the results of membership checks are cached. The caching duration varies and is influenced by factors such as the membership result (whether the principal is a member or not), the type of principal (user or application), among others. The maximum caching duration can extend up to three hours, while the minimum duration is 30 minutes.
