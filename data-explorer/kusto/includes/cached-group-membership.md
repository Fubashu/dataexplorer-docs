Checking group memberships can be resource-intensive. Since group memberships donâ€™t change frequently, the membership check results are cached. The caching duration varies and determines how quickly changes to group memberships are updated. Adding someone to a group could take up to 30 minutes to propagate. Removing someone from a group can take up to three hours.
