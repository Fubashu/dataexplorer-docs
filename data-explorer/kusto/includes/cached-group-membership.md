Checking group memberships can be resource-intensive. Since group memberships don't change frequently, the results of membership checks are cached. The caching duration determines how quickly changes to group memberships are reflected. If someone is added to a group, it may take up to 30 minutes for this addition to be recognized. Conversely, if someone is removed from a group, it may take up to 3 hours for this removal to be recognized.
