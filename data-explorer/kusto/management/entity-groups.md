Entity groups are named entities  that are stored in a database and that the [macro-expand query operator](../query/macro-expand-operator.md) can reference.


Storing an entity group in the database instead of providing its value in the query text itself makes it easier to manage these objects.

## Management commands

|Function |Description|
|---------|-----------|
|[.alter entity_group](alter-entity-group.md) |Alters an existing entity group and stores it inside the database metadata |
|[.alter-merge entity_group](alter-merge-entity-group.md) |Alters and merges the value of an existing entity group. |
|[.create entity_group](create-entity-group.md) |Creates a stored entity group.|
|[.drop entity_group](drop-entity-group.md) |Drops an entity group from the database. |
|[.show entity_group(s)](show-entity-group.md) |Lists all the stored entity groups, or a specific entity group, in the current database.|

> [!NOTE]
> A query can only reference entity groups defined in the query text or in the scoped database. Entity groups in other databases or clusters can't be referenced directly or indirectly.
