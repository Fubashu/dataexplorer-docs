# Regex syntax

> [!INCLUDE [applies](../includes/applies-to-version/applies.md)] [!INCLUDE [fabric](../includes/applies-to-version/fabric.md)] [!INCLUDE [azure-data-explorer](../includes/applies-to-version/azure-data-explorer.md)] [!INCLUDE [monitor](../includes/applies-to-version/monitor.md)] [!INCLUDE [sentinel](../includes/applies-to-version/sentinel.md)]

This article provides an overview of regular expression syntax supported by [Kusto Query Language (KQL)](index.md).

There are a number of KQL operators and functions that perform string matching, selection, and extraction with regular expressions, such as [`matches regex`](matches-regex-operator.md), [`parse`](parse-operator.md), and [`replace_regex()`](replace-regex-function.md).

In KQL, regular expressions must be encoded as [string literals](scalar-data-types/string.md) and follow the string quoting rules. For example, the regular expression `\A` is represented in KQL as `"\\A"`. The extra backslash indicates that the other backslash is part of the regular expression `\A`.

## Syntax

The following sections document the regular expression syntax supported by Kusto.

### Match one character

| Pattern     | Description |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.`         | Any character except new line (includes new line with s flag).|
| `[0-9]`     | Any ASCII digit.|
| `[^0-9]`    | Any character that isn't an ASCII digit. |
| `\d`        | Digit (`\p{Nd}`). |
| `\D`        | Not a digit.|
| `\pX`       | Unicode character class identified by a one-letter name.|
| `\p{Greek}` | Unicode character class (general category or script).|
| `\PX`       | Negated Unicode character class identified by a one-letter name.|
| `\P{Greek}` | Negated Unicode character class (general category or script). |

### Character classes

| Pattern        | Description                                                             |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `[xyz]`        | Character class matching either x, y or z (union).                      |
| `[^xyz]`       | Character class matching any character except x, y, and z.               |
| `[a-z]`        | Character class matching any character in range a-z.                    |
| `[[:alpha:]]`  | ASCII character class ([A-Za-z]).                                        |
| `[[:^alpha:]]` | Negated ASCII character class ([^A-Za-z]).                               |
| `[x[^xyz]]`    | Nested/grouping character class (matching any character except y and z). |
| `[a-y&&xyz]`   | Intersection (matching x or y).                                          |
| `[0-9&&[^4]]`  | Subtraction using intersection and negation (matching 0-9 except 4).     |
| `[0-9--4]`     | Direct subtraction (matching 0-9 except 4).                              |
| `[a-g~~b-h]`   | Symmetric difference (matching `a` and `h` only).                        |
| `[\[\]]`       | Escape in character classes (matching [ or ]).                           |
| `[a&&b]`       | Empty character class matching nothing.                                  |

> [!NOTE]
> Any named character class may appear inside a bracketed `[...]` character class. For example, `[\p{Greek}[:digit:]]` matches any ASCII digit or any codepoint in the `Greek` script. `[\p{Greek}&&\pL]` matches Greek letters.

Precedence in character classes is from most binding to least binding:

1. Ranges: `[a-cd]` == `[[a-c]d]`
2. Union: `[ab&&bc]` == `[[ab]&&[bc]]`
3. Intersection, difference, symmetric difference: All have equivalent precedence, and are evaluated from left-to-right. For example, `[\pL--\p{Greek}&&\p{Uppercase}]` == `[[\pL--\p{Greek}]&&\p{Uppercase}]`.
4. Negation: `[^a-z&&b]` == `[^[a-z&&b]]`.

### Composites

| Pattern |  Description                          |
|---------|---------------------------------------|
| `xy`    | Concatenation (`x` followed by `y`)   |
| `x\|y`  | Alternation (`x` or `y` , prefer `x`) |

### Repetitions

| Pattern   | Description                                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `x*`      | Zero or more of x (greedy)                   |
| `x+`      | One or more of x (greedy)                    |
| `x?`      | Zero or one of x (greedy)                    |
| `x*?`     | Zero or more of x (ungreedy/lazy)            |
| `x+?`     | One or more of x (ungreedy/lazy)             |
| `x??`     | Zero or one of x (ungreedy/lazy)             |
| `x{n,m}`  | At least n x and at most m x (greedy)        |
| `x{n,}`   | At least n x (greedy)                        |
| `x{n}`    | Exactly n x                                  |
| `x{n,m}?` | At least n x and at most m x (ungreedy/lazy) |
| `x{n,}?`  | At least n x (ungreedy/lazy)                 |
| `x{n}?`   | Exactly n x                                  |

### Empty matches

| Pattern           | Description                                                               |
|------------------ |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `^`               | Beginning of a haystack or start-of-line with multi-line mode.           |
| `$`               | End of a haystack or end-of-line with multi-line mode.                   |
| `\A`              | Only the beginning of a haystack, even with multi-line mode enabled.      |
| `\z`              | Only the end of a haystack, even with multi-line mode enabled.            |
| `\b`              | Unicode word boundary with `\w` on one side and `\W`, `\A`, or `\z` on other. |
| `\B`              | Not a Unicode word boundary.                                               |
| `\b{start}`, `\<` | Unicode start-of-word boundary with `\W\|\A` at the start of the string and `\w` on the other side.  |
| `\b{end}`, `\>`   | Unicode end-of-word boundary with `\w` on one side and `\W\|\z` at the end.    |
| `\b{start-half}`  | Half of a Unicode start-of-word boundary with `\W\|\A` at the beginning of the boundary. |
| `\b{end-half}`    | Half of a Unicode end-of-word boundary with `\W\|\z` at the end. |

### Grouping and flags

| Pattern          | Description                                                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `(exp)`          | Numbered capture group (indexed by opening parenthesis).           |
| `(?P<name>exp)`  | Named capture group (names must be alpha-numeric). |
| `(?<name>exp)`   | Named capture group (names must be alpha-numeric). |
| `(?:exp)`        | Non-capturing group.  |
| `(?flags)`       | Set flags within current group. |
| `(?flags:exp)`   | Set flags for exp (non-capturing). |

Capture group names can contain only alpha-numeric Unicode codepoints, dots `.`, underscores `_`, and square brackets`[` and `]`. Names must start with either an `_` or an alphabetic codepoint. Alphabetic codepoints correspond to the `Alphabetic` Unicode property, while numeric codepoints correspond to the union of the `Decimal_Number`, `Letter_Number` and `Other_Number` general categories.

Flags are single characters. For example, `(?x)` sets the flag `x` and `(?-x)` clears the flag `x`. Multiple flags can be set or cleared at the same time: `(?xy)` sets both the `x` and `y` flags and `(?x-y)` sets the `x` flag and clears the `y` flag. By default all flags are disabled unless stated otherwise. They are:

<a name="flags"></a>

| Flag    | Description |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `i`     | Case-insensitive: letters match both upper and lower case. |
| `m`     | Multi-line mode: `^` and `$` match begin/end of line. |
| `s`     | Allow dot (.). to match `\n`. |
| `R`     | Enables CRLF mode: when multi-line mode is enabled, `\r\n` is used. |
| `U`     | Swap the meaning of `x*` and `x*?`. |
| `u`     | Unicode support (enabled by default).|
| `x`     | Verbose mode, ignores whitespace and allow line comments (starting with `#`). |

In verbose mode, whitespace is ignored everywhere, including within character classes. To insert whitespace, use its escaped form or a hex literal. For example, `\ ` or `\x20` for an ASCII space.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Flags can be toggled within a pattern. For example, the following syntax uses a case-insensitive match for the first part and a case-sensitive match for the second part: `(?i)a+(?-i)b+`.
> * `a+` matches either `a` or `A`, but the `b+` only matches `b`.
> * Multi-line mode means `^` and `$` no longer match just at the beginning or end of the input, but also at the beginning or end of lines. Note that `^` matches after new lines, even at the end of input.
> * When both CRLF mode and multi-line mode are enabled, then `^` and `$` match either `\r` and `\n`, but never in the middle of a `\r\n`.
> * Unicode mode can also be selectively disabled, although only when the result *would not* match invalid UTF-8. For example, using an ASCII word boundary instead of a Unicode word boundary might make some regex searches run faster: `(?-u:\b).+(?-u:\b)` to match `$$abc$$`.

## Performance

This section provides some guidance on speed and resource usage of regex expressions.

### Unicode can affect memory usage and search speed

KQL regex provides first class support for Unicode. In many cases, the extra memory required to support Unicode is negligible and doesn't typically affect search speed.

The following are some examples of Unicode character classes that can affect memory usage and search speed:

* **Memory usage**: The effect of Unicode primarily arises from the use of Unicode character classes. Unicode character classes tend to be larger in size. For example, the `\w` character class matches around 140,000 distinct codepoints by default. This requires more memory and can slow down regex compilation. If ASCII satisfies your requirements, use ASCII classes instead of Unicode classes. The ASCII-only version of `\w` can be expressed in multiple ways, all of which are equivalent.

    ```
    [0-9A-Za-z_]
    (?-u:\w)
    [[:word:]]
    [\w&&\p{ascii}]
    ```

* **Search speed**: Unicode tends to be handled well, even when using large Unicode character classes. However, some of the faster internal regex engines can't handle a Unicode aware word boundary assertion. So if you don't need Unicode-aware word boundary assertions, you might consider using `(?-u:\b)` instead of `\b`. The `(?-u:\b)` uses an ASCII-only definition of a word character, which can improve search speed.

### Literals can accelerate searches

KQL regex has a strong ability to recognize literals within a regex pattern, which can significantly speed up searches. If possible, including literals in your pattern can greatly improve search performance. For example, in the regex `\w+@\w+`, first occurrences of `@` are matched and then a reverse match is performed for `\w+` to find the starting position.
